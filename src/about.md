Hi! My name is Margaux Laurier and I prefer to introduce myself as a Creative Developer.

I am currently studying Graphic and Digital Media at the AP Hogeschool, but I soon knew that my main interest was coding. That is why I chose the elective course Advanced Front-end Coding again this year and took my first steps in the React and Eleventy world. In the future I would like to focus on custom built React Native websites and challenging projects.
